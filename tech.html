    <div name="self-intro">
        <p>I had my first exposure to coding when I was 13 years old. I was invited to join our school coding team with three other peers. 
        At the time, we used Pascal and C+. They all looked extraterritorial to me. I felt being the only stupid person on the team. I was disappointed for totally failing the contest. 
        Years later, I thought back on the experience and I was proud of having gone through this excruciating mind-exercise. <br><br>
        When I was on my maternity leave, I had some free time so I reconnected with coding. I self-learned Python and programmed simple games that I could use to pass time.
        Till today, I become busier as a single mother working multiple jobs and taking care of a little one. I was still drawn to this fascinating world of coding. 
        I took the course Intro to Web Dev with Stack Education. And here I'm creating a website of my own for the very first time. 
        Languages are an art; arts are an alternative form of expression, coding is, too, an creative spell for making things possible! </p>
